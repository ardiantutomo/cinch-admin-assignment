# FastAPI Application for Product Management

This FastAPI application is built to simulate the flow of product creation as an internal application for Cinch.
This repo is very simple and only contains the basic features of the product management. I create it to showcase my skills and knowledge in FastAPI.
This is a minimalistic implementation of the product creation flow and of course, it can be improved.
Please check the laravel repo first for setup the database and tables.
